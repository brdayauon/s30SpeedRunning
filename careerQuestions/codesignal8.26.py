# oncat edge letters: given an array string, output the result. 
# for example:
# input = [dog, cat, cow]
# output = ['dt','cw',cg'] 
# dt: because beginining of dog and t because end of cat.
# cw: because beginning of cat and w because end of cow
# cg: because beginning of cow and g because end of dog 
# reduceTheNumber: given array, and k as parameters, return the string.
# input = ["1111122222"]
# output = ["12312"] i think?
# given an array of digits, find out how many pairs have the same bits. 
# input: [3,5,1,7,8,10,62,13]
# output: 5
# because:
# bitArray: [2,2,1,3,1,2,5,3]
# basically find the pairs in bit array
